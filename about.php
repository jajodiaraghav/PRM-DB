	          	<p class="lead">We have developed a web interface <a href="http://www.prm-db.org">PRM-DB</a> that contains all the new data and
				  previous phage-derived data on PDZ, SH3 and WW domains (Teyra et al., 2017; Tonikian et al., 2008, 2009; Xin et al., 2013)
				  to assemble an online database of 8,156 unique and validated peptide ligands for 523 PRMs representing 70 structural families.
				  The database can be queried by family or protein name and restrict the search by species. It provides information on the logos,
				  the top three best peptide binders and the closest PRM structure in complex to a peptide. In addition, the user can download
				  the full list of peptide ligands, the PWM matrices containing the amino acid frequencies, and a list of the most similar PDB 
				  structures of PRM-peptide complexes. Finally, the user can also download a pre-calculated list of predicted protein binders 
				  generated from scanning the human proteome with the PWMs that can help to prioritize the biological experiments on novel 
				  targets (Jain and Bader, 2016). Thus, the compiled and searchable database should facilitate many structural, functional 
				  and biological studies of PRMs and SLiMs.</p>
